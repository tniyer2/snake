# Snake Game

A clone of Snake made in Unity.

Build
===
You can play the game on a browser using the [prebuilt WebGL build](https://github.com/tniyer2/snake/releases/tag/1.0.0).

Once unzipped, serve the static content locally.
You can do this by using python:
```
python3 -m http.server
```
Then navigate to "localhost:PORT" in a browser.
PORT being whatever port http.server opened on (most likely 8000).

Instructions
===
Use the arrow keys or "wasd" to move the snake around.
Press the spacebar to pause the game and open the menu.
Collect as many apples as possible without hitting
any of the walls or your own body.
